# Task 1 variables 
''' 1) Create a variable named pi and store the value 22/7 in it.
Now check the data type of this variable.'''
pi = 22/7

'''2) Create a variable called for and assign it a value 4. See what
happens and find out the reason behind the behavior that you
see.'''
# for = 4

'''3) Store the principal amount, rate of interest, and time in
different variables and then calculate the Simple Interest for 3
years. Formula: Simple Interest = P x R x T / 100 '''

rate_of_interest = 5
time = 3
